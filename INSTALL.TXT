To install tpasm, just type

make

In the outermost directory.

Then, assuming it compiled properly, you will have an executable
called "tpasm" (also located in the outer directory).

If you want to place it into /usr/local/bin, you can
type:

make install

That's it :-)

If you experience any problems during the build, or any warnings
from your compiler, please email to let me know. Thanks.

NOTE: There is a directory called "include" in the tpasm source
tree which contains header files which are useful for various
processor families. Currently, none of these files is installed
anywhere when you issue "make install".
